# Convergence 0.1

Broke: Hey guys, let's make yet another ideology
that concerns itself with the distribution of resources,
the means of production and everyone's proper place in society. We'll
totally get it right this time. (Given the level of 
bullshit in society and the opportunity it affords
for those concerned with power, this notion is kind 
of understandable.)
         
Bespoke: We are literally this fking close
to an industrial revolution within our lifetimes.
What else is worth working on? Good luck developing anything
when modern supply chains collapse.
