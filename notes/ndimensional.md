   <b>Why use a superfluous phrase like “n-dimensional consequences?”</b>

At the risk of coming off a bit silly, I feel the phrase accurately captures the unseen, unexpected, and underappreciated effects this technology - ever expanding in form and function - has on us both as individuals and as a people. The information war will continue to come at us sideways, and it would be useful to normalize language which captures this essence. We owe it to ourselves to instill a lens that removes the possibility of euphemistically abstracting away the impact of a system which terraforms our perception and has demonstrated the ability to disrupt our functioning as a species. In the present future, what was absurd but a moment ago becomes antiquated methodology long before it’s an accepted conclusion.
