# Emergence

Given a convergence of resource constraints, in order to mitigate an environment of unpredictable inputs, manufacturing of the future should focus its efforts on the use of metamaterials for the production of products and infrastructure. 

## 1. Fabrication
- Our main limiting factor in exploiting metamaterials is in our ability to manufacturer them.
	- In order to a encourage healthy ecosystem of innovation, the base layer of fabrication abilities, namely 3d printing systems capable of continuous production of long range order on micro and nano meter scales require extensive development to reduce the capital and expertise required in their construction and operation.
