The various flavors of intellect on display seem ripe for the synthesis of novel frames by which to view the complex nature of challenges facing the 21st century.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0 c10">&ldquo; - Feb. 5th 2022</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;When automated disinformation began ten years ago in the U.S., as a society, we lacked the shared experiences to inform the language necessary to adequately communicate the n-dimensional consequences made possible by the ever advancing evolution of networking technologies on social discourse. We were already 10 years into a now antiquated model of narrative control that, at the time, seemed absurd to articulate any aspect of. By then we were already 25 years into the societal evolution of &ldquo;solving for short-term profit above all else&rdquo;, supercharging an imbalance of influence which laid the foundation for the failure of institutions to properly administer society for its long-term continuity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;For years we said we needed to educate the children, and in its place we gave them the drama of war. Instead of using the overflowing abundance of the post-WW2 order to continually invest in the betterment of our people, we privatized punishment and education. We broke up the U.S., and sold it in pieces like the early days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. At each step, we sold our future in the name of immediate riches. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t know when the bill would come due, but we got our first real taste during lockdown when the institutions we pay for were unwilling to execute the functions that justify their existence. We were told &ldquo;government should be run like a business&rdquo; by voices of authority, not realizing that they too were spoiled children raised on overflowing cups. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;They forgot the gift that is the American spirit of &ldquo;representative&rdquo; in &ldquo;representative government.&rdquo; They forgot that it isn&#39;t America at any one moment that makes her beautiful, but her journey through time. They forgot it took good people doing the hard work of building systems to deliver on the promise of America enabled by the post WW2 configuration. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;In their predictable rush to glorify the past to assuage the dissonance of responsibility for navigating a world of complexity increasingly beyond their comprehension, we have been sold a cynical vision to manage our expectations as the neurotypical rust of power for the sake of power corrodes the foundation of organized society around us. While inspiring, citizens of the U.S. should not - with good cause - feel the need to reinvent institutions. Recently, we learned the price of cynicism in not expecting 100+ year institutional knowledge to mean something, but the idea of faith in social organizations beyond those we can directly observe is so broken that realization escapes us. In 2022, the very notion is absurd. Nothing is done unless it can make a profit. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;Soon we may learn the price of not investing in education and moonshot scientific goals given that nations are attempting to shift the global balance of power at a time when we need to think less in terms of national competition, and more in the direction of &ldquo;How do we navigate the challenges of the 21st century?&rdquo; Failing to do so would likely result in the drama of war being used to drown out the failure of societies to operate effectively.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;At their core, our conflicts are resource conflicts. I imagine the audience reading this doesn&rsquo;t need a primer on projected water shortages, crop failures due to temperature variation, the reduction of oxygen holding capacity of water in higher temperatures, the lack of insects to turn and fertilize the soil, peaking of phosphorous production in the next decade, mass migrations from coasts amid a society primed by two previous decades of tribal and grievance identity amplification, or the three to twenty-two other things each reader is a little surprised to not see in the list. Given current projections show a convergence of resource constraints, it is only reasonable to assume a convergence of conflicts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But there is hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;Since many of you have dived into prediction markets and threatcasting, you have inadvertently acquired some of the skills of intelligence analysts.
