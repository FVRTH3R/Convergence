   When automated disinformation began ten years ago in the U.S., as a society, we lacked the shared experiences to inform the language necessary to adequately communicate the n-dimensional consequences made possible by the ever advancing evolution of networking technologies on social discourse. We were already 10 years into a now antiquated model of narrative control that, at the time, seemed absurd to articulate any aspect of. By then we were already 15 years into the societal evolution of “solving for short-term profit above all else”, supercharging an imbalance of influence which laid the foundation for the failure of institutions to properly administer society for its long-term continuity.[^2]

</br>

   For years we said we needed to educate the children, and in its place we gave them the drama of war. Instead of using the overflowing abundance of the post-WW2 order to continually invest in the betterment of our people, we privatized punishment and education. We broke up the U.S., and sold it in pieces like the early days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. At each step, we sold our future in the name of immediate riches.

</br>

   We didn’t know when the bill would come due, but we got our first real taste during lockdown when the institutions we pay for were unwilling to execute the functions that justify their existence. We were told “government should be run like a business” by voices of authority, not realizing that they too were spoiled children raised on overflowing cups. 

</br>

   They forgot the gift that is the American spirit of “representative” in “representative government.” They forgot that it isn't America at any one moment that makes her beautiful, but her journey through time. They forgot it took good people doing the hard work of building systems to deliver on the promise of America enabled by the post WW2 configuration.

</br>

   In their predictable rush to glorify the past to assuage the dissonance of responsibility for navigating a world of complexity increasingly beyond their comprehension, we have been sold a cynical vision to manage our expectations as the neurotypical rust of power for the sake of power corrodes the foundation of organized society around us. While inspiring, citizens of the U.S. should not - with good cause - feel the need to reinvent institutions. Recently, we learned the price of cynicism in not expecting 100+ year institutional knowledge to mean something, but the idea of faith in social organizations beyond those we can directly observe is so broken that realization escapes us. In 2022, the very notion is absurd. Nothing is done unless it can make a profit.

</br>

   Soon we may learn the price of not investing in education and moonshot scientific goals given that nations are attempting to shift the global balance of power at a time when we need to think less in terms of national competition, and more in the direction of “How do we navigate the challenges of the 21st century?” Failing to do so would likely result in the drama of war being used to drown out the failure of societies to operate effectively.

</br>

   At their core, our conflicts are resource conflicts. I imagine the audience reading this doesn’t need a primer on projected water shortages, crop failures due to temperature variation, the reduction of oxygen holding capacity of water in higher temperatures, the lack of insects to turn and fertilize the soil, peaking of phosphorous production in the next decade, mass migrations from coasts amid a society primed by two previous decades of tribal and grievance identity amplification, or the three to twenty-two other things each reader is a little surprised to not see in the list. Given current projections show a convergence of resource constraints, it is only reasonable to assume a convergence of conflicts.

   Since many of you have dived into prediction markets and threatcasting, you have inadvertently acquired some of the skills of intelligence analysts. Bayesian analysis? Updating your priors? Reporting of your conclusions with confidence intervals and assumptions clearly stated? Anonymous critiquing of each other’s work? Your refusal to engage in emotional appeals and willingness to acknowledge when you're wrong is just the serendipitous cherry on top.

</br>

   Many of you are academics, investors, CEOs, philosophers, artists, engineers, and programmers - many of which were initially educated in science and mathematics.  Multiple institutions, organizations, and nations are represented. We have come here via different paths, have led very different lives, are very different people, and yet there is something within us that is the same.[^3] It is the thing that has set you apart your entire life.

</br>

   We are one of the few examples of cooperation amongst competing ideologies. In a world struggling to cope with the onslaught of information engineered to amplify our tribal tendencies, the preciousness and power of this gift cannot be understated. Given that collectively you have technical talent, institutional connections, a shared interest in influence techniques, and a healthy fear of grifters; you are the hope you have been waiting for. You are the seeds of the Second Renaissance. 

</br>

*waits for laughter to subside*

</br>

It took, at least, tens of millions to bring you all to this point. No one is coming because all of you are the investment. You are the people in the past who chose to adopt the prototype behaviors and cognitive frameworks necessary to bootstrap the activation energy needed to make reality the miracles tucked away in research papers and lab benches around the world. You exist in the corner of the world with the resources and stability to make it happen. There is no main character in this story, no chosen few, only those who choose.

Anon, the question you should ask yourself now is,

      The first half of this document was written early February of 2022 with the goal of applying for funding to support communities such as this that I feel are instrumental in sparking an explosive growth in our fabrication abilities with the goal of bringing the promise of metamaterials into the world.

     My observation from VC is that there exists some abstract n-dimensional construct, like a rotating tesseract, which represents our shared characteristics. We are all pieces of this tesseract, calling out our individual observations of the higher-dimensional metacrisis through which we are passing. If you have a rival in these parts, it is likely they share the most faces of the ‘tesseract’ with you. Truly a beautiful and constructive use of psychographic targeting.My observation from VC is that there exists some abstract n-dimensional construct, like a rotating tesseract, which represents our shared characteristics.
